# Chavyv.xyz Angular based project

This project was built by [Angular](https://angular.io/), [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/) (State management), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) (UI kit), [Hygraph](https://hygraph.com/) (Headless CMS), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) (GraphQL client), [Scully](https://scully.io/) (SSG Enabler), [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) (Browser automation), and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) (CI/CD). There's some customization from default use of some modules such as using Playwright instead of Puppeteer for Scully browser automation and build the SSG on Github Actions for prevent exceeding bundle size limit hobby account on Vercel.

## customization

I've created the [`environment.variable.ts`](https://github.com/akbar2habibullah/chavyv-xyz-angular/blob/master/src/environments/environment.variables.ts) in environment directory for easier customization. But it's just for the variables inside the Angular app. I'll create more comprehensives guides next time.
